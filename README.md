# Installer
Head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/Lilwiggy/counter-strike-rpc/releases">releases</a> and download the latest release.
The installtion process is as follows:

Step 1:
Hit install. (Mind blowing I know) It will try and automatically find your Steam directory. Assuming it does, you're done.

If it doesn't find your Steam directory, it will ask you for your steam directory.
Locate your steam directory from the browser window and hit "Ok".

# Running

Option 1:
Hit the button that says "Launch CS:GO"
This will minimize the application to your system tray (the ^ icon on your taskbar on the far right side).
To fully close it right click the counter strike icon and hit "Quit".

Option 2:
You can just run CS:GO with the presence application open and it will automatically update your presence

# Notes
If you open the presence application and you run into this error:
"Unhandled Exception: System.Net.HttpListenerException: Access is denied"
just right click the application and run it as administrator.
